            <li>2 level tablespoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 large free-range egg yolk</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>1 x Basic tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 handfuls of fresh basil</li>
            <li>60 g mozzarella cheese</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If your meat is not already minced, whiz it up in a food processor to the required consistency and place it in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Use the food processor to turn the bread into breadcrumbs, then add to the meat.</li>
            <li>Bash up the cumin seeds and dried chilli in a pestle and mortar, and pick and finely chop the rosemary leaves. Add to the mince with the dried oregano and egg yolk. Season well with sea salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>At this stage you could add your optional ingredients (peeling and finely chopping the onion and garlic first, then cooked together gently in 1 tablespoon of oil until tender and allowed to cool).</li>
            <li>Mix well, and, with wet hands, roll and pat into meatballs the size and shape you want (cook straight away or put on greaseproof paper and refrigerated for up to a day.)</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C and heat a thick-bottomed casserole pan on the hob.</li>
            <li>Swirl 4 tablespoons of oil around the pan and add your meatballs. Fry until brown all over, being careful not to break them up.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat down and cover with the Basic tomato sauce, pick the basil leaves and tear in fresh basil, tear over the mozzarella and finely grate over the Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Cook in the oven for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cheese is golden.</li>
        </ol>
